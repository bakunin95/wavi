# WAVI Web Application Viewer 2 (Node.js)

Generate a svg class diagram for your node.js web application.

WAVI is intended for developers who wish to document their web application or as a reverse engineering tool to recover 
the structure of a web application.

Web applications pose unique challenges when it comes to understanding and maintaining their heterogeneous structures, which often involve complex interactions between elements from different languages. Accurate and up-to-date documentation is rarely available and this calls for the proposal of reverse engineering approaches for the recovery and representation of such structures. The proposed package presents our ongoing work on Web Application Viewer (WAVI), a tool able to reverse engineer a web application's structure.


## Installation

Install WAVI package using npm.

    $ npm install wavi -g


In Ubuntu, add sudo:

    $ sudo npm install wavi -g

## Usage in your terminal (CLI): 

The first argument is the path to the website to be analyzed and the second argument is the path where the svg graph will be generated.

wavi path/to/website path/to/resultfile/graph.svg

Example:

```
wavi website/example result/example.svg

```

## In Ubuntu: 

Make sure you add /usr/local/bin to your environment variable PATH or use absolute path to wavi.
If you use nodejs instead of node you will get this error:

```
"node\r": No such file or directory
```

You can run wavi this way using nodejs keyword and you can also use the absolute path to wavi:

    $ nodejs /usr/local/bin/wavi /path/to/website graph.svg


## Example:

![Example](/es5/example/graph.jpg?raw=true "Example")
